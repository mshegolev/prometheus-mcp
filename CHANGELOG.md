## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **v4.0 correlation/federation tools were never registered.** `server.py`
  imported only `tools`, `tools_alertmanager`, and `tools_status`, so the
  `@mcp.tool` decorators in `tools_correlation` and `tools_federation` never
  ran against the live server. The four tools
  (`correlate_alerts_across_instances`, `group_alerts_by_service`,
  `detect_cascading_alerts`, `federation_list_instances`) are now wired into
  `server.py` and exposed. Unit tests passed only because they imported the
  modules directly.
- **Frozen `None` registry.** `tools_correlation` and `tools_federation_v4`
  captured `from _mcp import _registry` by value at import time, when it is
  still `None` (it is assigned during lifespan startup). Tools now call a new
  `_mcp.get_registry()` accessor that reads the live global at call time.
- **`federation_list_instances` import crash.** Its return type was a fieldless
  `dict` subclass used with `structured_output=True`, which FastMCP cannot turn
  into an output schema (`InvalidSignature`). Replaced with a proper
  `ListInstancesOutput` TypedDict in `models.py`. Also dropped a bogus
  `mcp.state.get("registry")` lookup (`mcp` has no `state` attribute).

### Added

- `tests/test_server_registration.py`: smoke test asserting the exact set of
  tools the server entry point exposes — guards against unregistered modules.

### Known issues

- **`federation_analyze_alerts` (`tools_federation_v4`) is NOT registered.** Its
  implementation references APIs that do not exist (`PrometheusClient.list_alerts`/
  `query`/`instance_name`, `RCAEngine(clients)` vs the real `(registry)`
  constructor, `output.warn`, `output.ok(content=…, structured_content=…)`,
  `CorrelationResult.dict()`, `registry.get_all_clients()`). It must be rewritten
  against the real engine/client APIs before it can be exposed.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Federation Support**: Multi-instance Prometheus queries with fan-out execution
  - Config file support for named Prometheus instances with per-instance auth
  - `instance` parameter added to all 16 Prometheus tools for targeted queries
  - Fan-out queries across all instances with `instance="all"` parameter
  - Subset targeting with `instances=[...]` parameter for specific instance groups

  - Global response size caps applied post-merge (500 metrics, 5000 range points)

- **Alertmanager Federation**: Multi-instance Alertmanager support with fan-out queries
  - Config file support for named Alertmanager instances with per-instance auth
  - `instance` parameter added to all 4 Alertmanager tools for targeted queries
  - Fan-out queries across all Alertmanager instances with `instance="all"`
  - Alert deduplication by fingerprint when identical alerts from HA cluster peers
  - `__alertmanager_instance__` label injection for source attribution

  - Federation mode detection and instance count reporting

- **Core Infrastructure**: Thread-safe registry and federation modules
  - `InstanceRegistry` for managing N PrometheusClient + AlertmanagerClient pairs
  - Per-instance authentication, TTL caches, and session lifecycle management
  - `federation.py` with ThreadPoolExecutor-based fan-out execution
  - Configurable worker pools, timeout handling, and structured error reporting

- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero behavioral change when no config file is present
  - Legacy mode creates single "default" entry from environment variables
  - All existing tool signatures and behavior preserved
  - Environment variable fallback for seamless v2.0 → v3.0 migration
